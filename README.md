Our data set covers the wagers placed at three different sports books in Connecticut over a three-year period (October 2021 â€“ September 2024). The data set gives us details about these three books, including patron winnings, total amount placed, number of wagers, and gaming revenue all on a monthly basis. This data set allows us to track the performance of each of these firms over the past three years and allows us to compare them to each other, showcasing the firm that receives the most wagers, and therefore makes the most in monthly revenue.

Question #1: What is the relationship between wagers placed and total gross gaming revenue?

This is important information for a gambling firm, as our visualization shows the relationship between the wagers placed and the total gambling revenue in a single month for each of the three firms. A firm may want to know this information so they can see which months they receive the most wagers, and therefore make more revenue. With this information, they can choose to take a more aggressive stance at marketing in the lower revenue months and attempt to get their users to bet more in those months by giving them promotions or extra credits to wager with.

Question #2: During what month are the most promotional coupons and extra credits given out?

This is an important question for these firms to ask because with our visualization we can start to track consumer behavior and see how the firms are optimizing their promotions. When put next to total revenue, we would hope to see a positive correlation between revenue and promotional coupons to indicate the promotions are working. We can also pick up on seasonal trends within these firms, the month-to-month trends could indicate seasonality in sports gambling, tied to major events like playoffs or championships. This information allows firms to prepare for high-activity periods with tailored promotions.

Explanation for Visualization #1:



For all three firms, we see a positive correlation between wagers placed and total gross gaming revenue. This was expected; however, we can see that CT Lottery Corp takes in the least number of wagers per month by far, explaining their lower levels of revenue. Mohegan Digital LLC and MPI Master Wagering License show similar numbers, although we can see that Mohegan has had the highest number of wagers in one month across the three firms, topping out at just over 98 million wagers in December of 2023.

Explanation for Visualization #2:

In our second visualization, we showcase the comparison between promotional coupons and total gross gaming revenue. We see an obvious correlation between promotions given out and gross gaming revenue for Mohegan Digital LLC and MPI Master Wagering License, showing that the promotions they are putting out do affect the gross revenue for that month. CT Lottery Corp, on the other hand, shows that their promotions may not be affecting their client base as they hoped they would, and may need to adjust their approach to increase gross revenue.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, we believe our two questions are critical ones to ask for these three gambling firms, and with the answers we can compare and contrast three large firms in Connecticut. Through our visualizations, we can infer that CT Lottery Corp is the smallest of the three, bringing in the lowest gross revenue on a monthly basis, as well as providing the least amount of promotional coupons to their customers. For the other two, we see a high correlation between promotional coupons and gross revenue, indicating highly productive promotions. Overall, the three firms that we analyzed continue to grow as the gambling sector grows at a high rate. We expect revenues as well as coupons to continue to increase for all three.
